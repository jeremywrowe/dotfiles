# jeremywrowe/dotfiles => ~/.dotfiles
My personal dotfiles - please rip them off if they help you.

## Install

* `git clone https://github.com/jeremywrowe/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
* `cd ~/.dotfiles/setup`
* `rake install`

*note* This will install all of my dotfiles and setup, do this at your own risk.
If you wish to only install part of my dotfiles you can do so by doing `rake -T`
and running the rake command that best fits your needs. I also highly recommend
you look at what each command is doing as they are very opinionted to my setup.
(naturally)
